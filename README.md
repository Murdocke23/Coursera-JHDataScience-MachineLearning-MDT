Prediction Assignment for Coursera Practical Machine Learning


Takes data provided from instructors based on HAR study found at http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har

Date data provided included:

* pml-training_csv: a training data set of approximately 20,000 records to use in developing a model
* pml-testing_csv:a smaller set to use for final model prediction



The R Markdown file is for processing the data, developing a model, and producing an output file via knitr. The HTML file is the output from that file.

The two .RData files are saved snapshots of the resulting models, for re-use and application without re-running the full model training, which can take some time.
